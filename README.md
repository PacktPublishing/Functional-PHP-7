## About the Video Course
Functional Programming offers a fundamental shift in the way you design your applications by focusing on the use and composition of pure functions to create programs that are robust, extensible, and easy to reason about. The traditional implementation of PHP codebase has been in the object-oriented paradigm. This course teaches you to think about coding problems in terms of the composition of pure functions. 

The course starts by covering PHP7’s internal closure object, enabling you to write very powerful functions. This course will help you think about problem solutions from the perspective of combining pure code-like pieces of a puzzle. Then, it provides helpful techniques and insights such as lazy function evaluation and currying that facilitate composing functions together. Finally, the course finalizes with taking an imperative program, and using pure function composition and learning about a functional library called PRamda.
